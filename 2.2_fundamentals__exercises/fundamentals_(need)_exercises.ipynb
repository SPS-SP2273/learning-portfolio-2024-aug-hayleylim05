    "1. Functions is a thing that does a specific task. For example, the `print()` function takes the words put inside the brackets and prints it to the svreen. \"()\" always follows a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _Python is interpreted one line at a time, starting from the top._\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Python is sensitive. Have to be careful with how we type our commands. Python will not accept a capital lettered word if it is supposed to be lower case.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add `#`' to write comments. Comments is used to write the purpose of the code\n",
    "\n",
    "5. _`=` is not the same as `==`. `=` is used to set something equal while `==` is used to check if something is equal_\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `if` is used to make decisions. It performs the argument that if something is something, an action, which is to be determined by the coder, will happen. If not, something else will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Be careful with indentations. Indentations are only used for True and False blocks, cannot anyhow use \n",
    "\n",
    "8. There is a difference between english and variable. To print an english word, we need to include open and close inverted commans \"\", without it, we are printing the variable instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Different kinds of brackets: `()` is for math and function, `[]` is for lists and `{}` is for a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Python can do math. We have to either start the line with `math` or `np`, then we add a dot, and type out the function to carry out the math equation\n",
    "_We need to first import the math or numpy package_\n",
    "\n",
    "11. _A dot `.` is used to indicate ownership_"
